Administrator Pete Gaynor approved Texas for a FEMA grant under the Lost Wages
Assistance program. FEMA’s grant funding will allow Texas to provide $300 per
week -- on top of their regular unemployment benefit -- to those unemployed due
to COVID-19. FEMA will work with Texas Governor Greg Abbott to implement a
system to make this funding available to Texas residents.
On Aug. 8, 2020, President Trump made available up to $44 billion from FEMA’s
Disaster Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to Americans who have lost
 wages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the state of Texas agreed to
 administer a lost wages program for its citizens who are unemployed due to COVID-19.
FEMA looks forward to working with the governors of additional states who agree
 to administer a lost wages program to bring financial relief to unemployed Americans.

  Because of school closures from COVID-19 during the 2019-2020 school year,
  Texas received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide more
   than $1 billion in pandemic food benefits to families with children that
    temporarily lost access to free or reduced-price school meals.
Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) provides eligible families with
a one-time payment for each child who previously received free or reduced-price
meals. P-EBT works the same way <a href="https://hhs.texas.gov/services/health/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-information-texans/pandemic-ebt-p-ebt-due-covid-19">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>
 benefits do and will help families get the food they need during the current
  pandemic. P-EBT will be administered by the Texas Health and Human Services
   Commission, Texas Department of Agriculture and Texas Education Agency.

serve our program participants across our 15 nutrition programs. We have
already begun to issue waivers to ease program operations and protect the health of participants.
