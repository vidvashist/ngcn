	about housing and utilities support during the COVID-19 pandemic can be
found on the Indiana state website.<br><br>
At <a href="https://www.in.gov/ihcda/coronavirus.htm">IHCDA</a> we recognize that the most effective way to inform Hoosiers about these
key resources is through our local network of community organizations like not-for-profits,
community foundations, Township Trustees, faith based organizations, local
elected officials and employers.

	 Administrator Pete Gaynor approved Indiana for a FEMA grant under the Lost
	 Wages Assistance program. FEMA’s grant funding will allow Indiana to provide
	 $300 per week -- on top of their regular unemployment benefit -- to those
	  unemployed due to COVID-19. FEMA will work with Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb
		to implement a system to make this funding available to Indiana residents.<br><br>
<a href="https://iedc.in.gov/resources/covid-19-updates-resources">The Indiana Economic Development Corporation</a>
 is working with the State of Indiana and the Indiana State Department of Health
 to closely monitor the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to
 continue supporting and providing resources for businesses in partnership with
 local and regional organizations across the state.
<br><br>
Recently, Gov. Holcomb announced new initiatives to provide financial assistance
 to Hoosiers as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first program, the <a href="https://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/rent-and-utility-assistance-for-hoosiers">Indiana COVID-19 Rental Assistance Program</a>,
will use $25 million in federal CARES Act funding to help Hoosiers struggling to pay rent.
The program will provide up to $500 per month for four months, totaling a
maximum of $2,000 to eligible renters to help cover past and ongoing rent
payments or late fees. Rental assistance through this program is available to
residents in all Indiana counties except Marion, where a local $15 million CARES
 Act-funded program will provide aid.
